## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

The add-on is already installed! Click **"Start"** to begin.

### 2. Configuration

Configure the add-on with your camera settings. You must provide **either** `camera_entity` **OR** `camera_url`:

**Option A: Using Home Assistant Camera Entity (Recommended)**
```yaml
camera_entity: "camera.your_doorbell_camera"
storage_path: "/share/doorbell"
retention_days: 30
face_confidence_threshold: 0.6
notification_webhook: ""
database_encryption: false
ha_access_token: ""
```

**Option B: Using Direct RTSP/HTTP URL**
```yaml
camera_url: "rtsp://192.168.1.100:554/stream"
storage_path: "/share/doorbell"
retention_days: 30
face_confidence_threshold: 0.6
notification_webhook: ""
database_encryption: false
```

**Configuration Options:**

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|--------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `camera_entity` | string | Either this OR camera_url | "" | Home Assistant camera entity ID (e.g., `camera.doorbell`) |
| `camera_url` | string | Either this OR camera_entity | `rtsp://192.168.1.100:554/stream` | Direct RTSP or HTTP URL of your camera |
| `storage_path` | string | No | `/share/doorbell` | Path to store images and database |
| `retention_days` | integer | No | 30 | Days to keep events (1-365) |
| `face_confidence_threshold` | float | No | 0.6 | Confidence threshold for face recognition (0.1-1.0) |
| `notification_webhook` | string | No | "" | Webhook URL for external notifications |
| `database_encryption` | boolean | No | false | Enable database encryption for face data |
| `ha_access_token` | string | No | "" | Long-lived access token (only needed if camera_entity is used) |

> **Note:** If using `camera_entity`, the addon will use Home Assistant's camera proxy. If using `camera_url`, it connects directly to the camera stream.

### 3. Setup Home Assistant Integration

#### Step 1: Add REST Command

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
rest_command:
  doorbell_ring:
    url: "http://d4f73725-doorbell-face-recognition:8099/api/doorbell/ring"
    method: POST
    headers:
      Content-Type: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    payload: >-
      ai_message={{ ai_message | urlencode }}&ai_title={{ ai_title | urlencode }}&image_path={{ image_path | urlencode }}&image_url={{ image_url | urlencode }}
    timeout: 30
```

> **Note:** The addon slug `d4f73725-doorbell-face-recognition` may vary. Check your addon details page for the exact address.

**Restart Home Assistant** after adding the REST command.

#### Step 2: Create Doorbell Automation

**Simple Automation (Face Recognition Only):**

```yaml
alias: Simple Doorbell Face Recognition
description: Trigger face recognition when doorbell is pressed
triggers:
  - entity_id: binary_sensor.your_doorbell_button
    from: "off"
    to: "on"
    trigger: state
actions:
  - target:
      entity_id: camera.your_doorbell_camera
    data:
      filename: "{{ snapshot_path }}"
    action: camera.snapshot
  - action: rest_command.doorbell_ring
    data:
      ai_message: "Doorbell pressed"
      ai_title: "Visitor at the door"
      image_path: "{{ snapshot_path }}"
      image_url: "{{ snapshot_url }}"
variables:
  timestamp: "{{ now().timestamp() | int }}"
  snapshot_path: /config/www/doorbell_snapshot_{{ timestamp }}.jpg
  snapshot_url: https://your-home-assistant-url.com/local/doorbell_snapshot_{{ timestamp }}.jpg
```

**Advanced Automation (with AI Descriptions):**

For a complete example with AI-generated descriptions, mobile notifications, TTS announcements, and more, see the [detailed automation guide](AUTOMATION.md).

#### Step 3: Customize Your Setup

Replace these placeholders:

| Placeholder | Replace With | How to Find |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| `binary_sensor.your_doorbell_button` | Your doorbell button entity | Developer Tools ‚Üí States ‚Üí Search for "doorbell" |

## üìä Home Assistant Integration

### Sensors

The addon creates the following sensors:

- `sensor.doorbell_last_event` - Timestamp of last doorbell event
- `sensor.doorbell_known_faces_today` - Count of known faces detected today
- `sensor.doorbell_unknown_faces_today` - Count of unknown faces detected today
- `sensor.doorbell_total_events` - Total number of events
- `sensor.doorbell_person_detected` - Name of last detected person
- `sensor.doorbell_confidence` - Confidence score of last detection

### Events

The addon fires these events for automations:

- `doorbell_face_detected` - Any face detected
- `doorbell_known_person` - Known person recognized
- `doorbell_unknown_person` - Unknown person detected

### Example Automation Using Events

```yaml
alias: Notify When Known Person Arrives
triggers:
  - platform: event
    event_type: doorbell_known_person
actions:
  - service: notify.mobile_app
    data:
      message: "{{ trigger.event.data.person_name }} is at the door!"
      title: "Welcome Home"
```

1. **Get Your Gotify URL and Token:**
   - Open your Gotify web interface
   - Go to **Apps** ‚Üí Create a new application (e.g., "Doorbell")
   - Copy the generated token
   - Your webhook URL format: `https://gotify.example.com/message?token=YOUR_TOKEN`

2. **Configure in Addon Settings:**
   - Open the addon **Web UI** (Settings page)
   - Scroll to the **Notifications** section
   - Paste your Gotify URL in the **Webhook URL** field
   - Click **Save Webhook URL**

3. **Test the Integration:**
   - Click the **Test Notifications** button
   - You should receive a test notification in Gotify
   - Check both Home Assistant notifications and Gotify

## üîß Troubleshooting

### No Events Appearing

- Check Home Assistant logs for REST command errors
- Verify the addon slug in the REST command URL
- Ensure the automation is triggering (check automation traces)
- Test camera connectivity using the "Capture" button in settings

### Face Recognition Not Working

- Ensure you've added people with face images first
- Check face confidence threshold (lower = more lenient)
- Verify images are clear and well-lit
- Check addon logs for face recognition errors

### Camera Connection Issues

- Test RTSP URL directly with VLC or similar
- Verify camera credentials in URL
- Check network connectivity to camera
- Try using Home Assistant camera entity instead

### AI Descriptions Not Showing

- The LLM Vision integration is optional
- Face recognition works without AI descriptions
- Check LLM Vision integration configuration
- Verify provider ID and model settings
